                 Digital marketing strategy development is the process of creating roadmaps and action
                  plans that guide business owners and marketers in achieving their brand objectives. 
                  To secure a competitive position in the online marketplace, every industry leader must 
                  
                  
                  have a definitive internet marketing plan to carry on operations and hit business goals.

                Many marketers, however, get right into search engine marketing (SEM) without a concrete
                 marketing strategy plan. This is a bad move, as the adage goes: “Failing to plan is 
                 
                 planning to fail.” Without a digital marketing plan, your search engine optimization 
                 (SEO) and other digital marketing efforts will struggle to get off the ground, and you 
                 won’t see the return on investment (ROI) you’re hoping for.
