Movies are one of the most impactful art forms when it comes to human mental consciousness. The journey of a viewer across a movie happens across three broad phases namely, pre-release, release, and post-release of the movie. All three are distinct and require different forms of engagement with the viewer. While the release and post-release phase is highly dependent on the content of the movie and the viewer experience around the same, the pre-release phase is under the control of producers. Filmmakers are continuously looking for new and advanced marketing techniques to maximize the potential of this phase to ensure higher viewer attraction and retention. This phase requires innovative marketing strategies to reach the target audience and engage them.Over the last decade digital marketing has emerged as an incredibly effective tool to develop a stronger connection with the audience. Furthermore, as this strategy can be easily measured through performance-related metrics, detailed insights can be consistently drawn to improve upon it.
