Reports are what retain clients, helping to demystify all of the “analytics” related to the effectiveness of digital marketing and follow trends. We are here to help you break digital marketing reporting for you into bite sized chunks!

We live in an age of never-ending digital content production and availability. Whether it is being blasted into our faces from our mobile phones or we are passively absorbing a couple of social media updates on our laptops, we are spending more and more time online every day. More and more people are flocking to social media and the internet to do their shopping, invest in companies, watch the news, and connect with friends and relatives. It is estimated that we spend more than 3.3 hours 
every single day online, wasting time, buying things, and reading whatever floats through our timelines.

Digital Marketing Reporting‍
‍At its core, marketing reporting is the process of measuring progress, showing value, and identifying actionable steps to improve marketing performance. The idea is to crunch the available numbers and analytics to help meet future marketing goals, whether that be earning more revenue, expanding service footholds, increasing the online audience, etc.

A digital marketing report can be broken down, generally, into the following structure, which we will explore in a coming chapter: summary (the section that breaks down the key points, including successes, challenges, and also upcoming goals); traffic metrics (top of the funnel acquisition numbers that are broken down by channel); engagement metrics (onsite activity and how much time a particular buyer spent on your site, how long until they left, etc.); conversion metrics (these are the golden numbers – they are telling a client the cost per lead or acquisition so they can determine if they want to keep investing); and business impact metrics (these numbers cover opportunities, pipeline generated, and revenue).

Depending upon the types of campaigns that you are running, you will want your reports broken down for PPC, SEO, social media, content marketing, account-based marketing, revenue reports, and overall comparison reports.
